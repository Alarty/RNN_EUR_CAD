###This project is an exploratory project to learn about LSTM/RNN, and apply it on market data

###The goal is to predict the next business day closing exchange rate between EUR and CAD

To do list :
* Learn the relative rate change,  day to day instead of the real 
* Add small noise in data to have more data ?
* Add weekday for information ?
* Try a longer full LSTM sequence ? (not only the N last to guess the next)
