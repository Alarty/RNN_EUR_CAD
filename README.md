###This project is an exploratory project to learn about LSTM/RNN, and apply it on market data

###The goal is to predict the next business day closing exchange rate between EUR and CAD

To do list :
* Add other date info for information (holiday, christmas, or even raw day/month) ?
* Try a longer full LSTM sequence ? (not only the N last to guess the next)
